Break down the silos between AI platforms and empower users to:

ChatBridge is a Chrome extension that bridges conversations between AI chat platforms like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, and more. It captures your chats, transforms them intelligently (summarize, rewrite, translate, sync tone), and restores them across platforms ‚Äî all locally and securely.

- **Switch platforms freely** without losing conversation context

- **Transform conversations** to match the communication style of different AI models## üéØ Project Aim

- **Build a second brain** with automatic knowledge extraction and cross-context memory

- **Visualize connections** with an interactive force-directed knowledge graph**Features:**

- **Enhance productivity** with intelligent summarization, translation, and rewriting

- **Maintain privacy** with local-first processing and secure API key storageBreak down the silos between AI platforms and empower users to:



---- **Switch platforms freely** without losing conversation context

- **Smart Message Extraction**: Precisely captures user and assistant messages from chat platforms

## üîç Problem Statement- **Transform conversations** to match the communication style of different AI models

- **Enhance productivity** with intelligent summarization, translation, and rewriting

### The Challenge- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works with Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Poe, and more

- **Maintain privacy** with local-first processing and secure API key storage

As AI assistants proliferate, users face several key problems:

## üéØ Project Aim- **Context Preservation**: Maintains conversation history when switching between platforms

1. **Context Loss**: Starting fresh conversations on a new platform means losing valuable context

2. **Platform Lock-in**: Conversations become trapped in a single platform's ecosystem---

3. **Manual Copying**: Time-consuming copy-paste between platforms with formatting issues- **UI Chrome Filtering**: Intelligently excludes buttons, suggestions, and system messages

4. **Model-Specific Language**: Each AI has different "styles" that work better with specific prompts

5. **Information Overload**: Long conversations become difficult to reference and share## üîç Problem Statement

6. **Lost Insights**: Valuable knowledge from past conversations is forgotten or buried

Break down the silos between AI platforms and empower users to:- **Restore Conversations**: Paste and continue conversations in chat inputs

### Extension not visible### Basic Workflow

- Ensure Developer mode is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`

- Check that extension is loaded and toggle is ON

- Reload the extension or restart Chrome

1. **Scan a Conversation**

### Scan Chat returns empty

- Check browser console (F12) for `[Debug]` logs   - Open any AI chat (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)- Save and organize multiple conversation histories1. Add a new adapter object to `SiteAdapters` array in `adapters.js`:

- Some platforms need page fully loaded - wait and retry

- Ensure you're on a supported platform (see list above)   - Click the ‚ö° button (bottom-right)



### Restore not working   - Click **"üì∏ Scan Chat"**- Quick preview of saved conversations

- Some platforms use React/Vue inputs requiring special events

- Try clicking in the input field before clicking Restore   - The sidebar shows your captured conversation

- Check console for errors

- Dropdown selector for easy access```javascript

### Knowledge Graph empty

- Scan at least one conversation first2. **Transform with AI Tools**

- Wait for knowledge extraction to complete (async, ~3s)

- Check localStorage: `localStorage.getItem('chatbridge:knowledge_graph')`   - Local storage with Chrome sync support{



### Contradictions not alerting   **üéöÔ∏è Sync Tone** - Optimize for another AI model:

- Check if entities overlap (must have shared entities)

- Verify contradictory words exist (better/worse, use/avoid, etc.)   - Select target model (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.)

- Enable debug and check console

   - Click **"üéöÔ∏è Sync Tone"**## üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack  },

```
```## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### For Developers

- ‚úÖ **Open Source**: Learn from clean, well-documented code4. Look for `[Platform Debug]` logs showing exactly what's being extracted

- ‚úÖ **Extensible**: Easy adapter pattern for new platforms

- ‚úÖ **Modern**: Manifest V3, Shadow DOM, async/await patterns4. **Start using**5. File an issue with the console output



### For Organizations   - Navigate to any supported AI chat platform

- ‚úÖ **Cost Effective**: Maximize value from multiple AI subscriptions

- ‚úÖ **Vendor Independence**: Avoid lock-in to single platform   - Click the ‚ö° floating button (bottom-right corner)### Restore not working in chat input

- ‚úÖ **Knowledge Management**: Preserve and organize AI conversations

- ‚úÖ **Multilingual Support**: Global team collaboration   - Click **"üì∏ Scan Chat"** to capture the conversation



---   - Use the AI tools (Sync Tone, Summarize, Rewrite, Translate)Some platforms use React-controlled inputs. The extension dispatches both `input` and `change` events, and manually focuses/blurs the input to trigger React's reconciliation.



## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting   - Click **"‚ôªÔ∏è Restore"** to paste into another platform's chat



### Extension not visible## Roadmap

- Ensure Developer mode is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`

- Check that extension is loaded and toggle is ON### API Key Setup (Optional)

- Reload the extension or restart Chrome

- [ ] Add support for more platforms (Anthropic Console, Cohere, etc.)

### Scan Chat returns empty

- Check browser console (F12) for debug logsChatBridge uses Google Gemini API for AI features. A default key is included for testing, but you can add your own:- [ ] Improve message deduplication logic

- Some platforms need page fully loaded - wait and retry

- Ensure you're on a supported platform (see list above)- [ ] Add conversation export/import



### Restore not working1. Get a free Gemini API key at [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)- [ ] Implement conversation branching visualization

- Some platforms use React/Vue inputs requiring special events

- Try clicking in the input field before clicking Restore2. Click the ChatBridge extension icon- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts

- Check console for errors

3. Click **"Settings"** (or right-click extension ‚Üí Options)- [ ] Support for multi-turn conversation editing

### Extension context invalidated---

- Happens when extension is reloaded during use

- Storage automatically falls back to localStorage**Note**: This extension requires API keys for AI platforms. Keys are stored locally in Chrome's secure storage and never transmitted to third parties.

- Reload the page to restore full functionality

## üìñ How to Use

- [ ] Conversation search and filtering   

- [ ] Support for more AI platforms (Cohere, Anthropic Console, etc.)   **üéöÔ∏è Sync Tone** - Optimize for another AI model:

- [ ] Conversation analytics and insights   - Select target model (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.)

- [ ] Team/shared conversation spaces   - Click **"üéöÔ∏è Sync Tone"**

   - Wait for transformation (shows progress)

---   - Click **"Insert to Chat"** to paste optimized version
